<Task>
Develop a full-stack application based on templates folder (nextjs-starter for frontend and nodejs-starter for backend) to track books read by users. The application should:
Allow the user to add a new book in a dedicated UI section
The book must contain the following:
- Title
- Author
- ISBN number
- Number of pages
- 1-5 rating

The book must be saved in database that can be deployed locally.

1. The application should validate the data & show appropriate error messages
2. Allow the user to list the books in a dedicated UI section
3. Handle amounts of data as huge as 10 mln records. The API should be performant and scalable
4. Add a search functionality on the Title and Author fields
5. Authentication is not required in the application. The book list functions as a global library, allowing everyone to add new books and search for entries added by others

Create monorepo which will be for frontend and backend. Templates are just guide how to do it!
